        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the oats and any optional add-ins (e.g., chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, or dried fruit) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Flatten each cookie slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Bake for approximately 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the delicious oat cookies!</li><br/>

        <h3>Notes on Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            Do not overbeat your batter as it will result in a tough cake.<br>
            To avoid overcooking, check your cake after 25 minutes of baking.<br>
            Make sure the cake is completely cool before frosting it, or you'll end up with a melted frosting.<br>

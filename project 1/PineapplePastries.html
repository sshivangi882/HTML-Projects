        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and chilled, cubed butter. Use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the cold water, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the dough chills, prepare the pineapple filling. In a saucepan, combine the pineapple chunks, granulated sugar, water, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes glossy.</li>
            <li>Remove the pineapple filling from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow it to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out small circles or squares using a cookie cutter or a knife.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of the pineapple filling in the center of each pastry piece.</li>
            <li>Fold the pastry over the filling, pressing the edges together to seal. You can use a fork to create a decorative pattern along the edges.</li>
            <li>Place the filled pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the pastries cool, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth and pourable.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the glaze over the cooled pastries.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy the delightful pineapple pastries!</li><br/>

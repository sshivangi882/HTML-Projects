        <p>
            You can customize the fruit combination based on your preferences and what's in season. Ensure the fruits are diced into small pieces to distribute them evenly in the dough. Store the cookies in an airtight container for freshness.

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the diced mixed fruits until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some granulated sugar on top of each cookie for a touch of sweetness and added texture.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. </li>
            <li>Enjoy the delightful fruit cookies!</li><br>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until well combined.</li>
            <li>Reduce the speed and slowly add the boiling water, mixing until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>In a chilled mixing bowl, beat the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the cake.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of whipped cream over the cherry filling.</li>
            <li>Place the second cake layer on top and repeat with another layer of cherry filling and whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Garnish the top of the cake with chocolate shavings or grated chocolate, if desired.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the delicious Black Forest Cake!</li><br/>

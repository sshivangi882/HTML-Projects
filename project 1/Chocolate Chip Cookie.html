        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Avoid overmixing.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may appear slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough until all cookies are baked.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</li><br>
